# Lingua Unagi

### Our Project

For this project, we want to help immigrants to the United States who speak English as an additional language. Our plan is to create a tool for non-native speakers to identify mistakes in their English writing that might be common in translation from their native language, perhaps as informed by crowdsourced submission with monitored review. We believe this tool will be able to especially help first-generation students in their graduate school applications and cover letters.
